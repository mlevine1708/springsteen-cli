# Springtseen::Cli
Bruce Springsteen CLI

Welcome to the Bruce Springsteen CLI.  In this gem, you will be able to access a list of all of Bruce's albums from his entire career.  You can then select an album, by the number, and get more details about that specific album (description, producer, release date, etc.).  

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'springtseen-cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install springtseen-cli

## Usage

Select a Bruce Springsteen album to learn more about it.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
